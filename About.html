          December 2007, It's my first plane ride and first out of the country.
          Yes, I went to Dubai not for leisure but for work. It is a multi
          culture country hence living there with no relatives or friends was
          never easy. I worked in a hotel as a housekeeping coordinator. After
          two (2) years I moved in a construction firm owned by Australians and
          became the Office Manager. After a few years, went back to Philippines
          and have my own family. Currently I am working as a paralegal in one
          of the law firms in San Juan City.

          I am a graduate of Diploma in Office Management in year 2007.
          Fortunate enough I got jobs which is inclined to the program I have
          studied. However I felt that there's still something missing, then I
          realized I wanted to achieve another dream and that is getting a
          bachelors degree, hence I decided to study again. Despite my age, I am
          currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in
          the same school.
